VRChat Melon Assistant is a PC mod installer for VRChat. It uses mods published in [VRChat Modding Group Discord](https://discord.gg/rCqKSvR).  
It's a (very stripped down) fork of [Assistant's Mod Assistant](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant), a mod manager for Beat Saber.  
**Modifying the VRChat client is not allowed by VRChat Terms of Service and can lead to your account being banned.** Mods available via this installer are manually checked to minimize the chance of that happening, but the risk is always there.  
VRChat Melon Assistant is not affiliated with and/or endorsed by VRChat Inc.

## Features

VRChat Melon Assistant boasts a rich feature set, some of which include:
* Installed mod detection
* Mod uninstallation
* Broken mod move-aside (temporarily uninstalls them until a fix is available)
* Complex theming engine
* Headpats and Hugs

## Usage
Download the newest build from the release section and run it. This application auto-updates when launched, there is no need to download a new release each time.  
Then, simply check off the mods that you wish to install or update and click the <kbd>Install or Update</kbd> button. Likewise, click the <kbd>Uninstall</kbd> button to remove any mods.


## Themes
VRChat Melon Assistant should support themes for Mod Assistant. Check [its README](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant#themes) for more info on theming.  
However, this is not a supported feature. If something doesn't work, don't complain to either Assistant or knah.

## Common Issues
**I hit install but I don't see anything in game!**
  Double check that you followed the [Usage](#usage) instructions correctly.  
  Make sure you're looking in the right place. Sometimes mod menus move as modding libraries/practices change.  
  Additionally, make sure the proper VRChat installation directory is selected in option tab.
  
**I don't see a certain mod in the mods list!**
  VRChat Melon Assistant uses mods from VRChat Modding Group and shows whatever is available for download. It's recommended to avoid non-VRCMG mods due to rampant spread of malware disguised as mods.
  
**I hit install but now my game won't launch, I can't click any buttons, I only see a black screen, etc**
  Please visit the [VRChat Modding Group](https://discord.gg/rCqKSvR) `#help-and-support` channel. Check the pinned messages or ask for help and see if you can work out things out.
